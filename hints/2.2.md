# 2.2

I assume that you've got already the 2.1 solution. Using it, you can now generate all numbers from 0 to N. 
Then you can check if one of the generated numbers is the number that you're looking for. 
If yes, you can use the same technic to set a member variable to true as in the previous exercise. 
To do that you need a helper struct/class. If you still don't know how to do it, 
the solution is available on Github, but do you really need it?
