# Ex. 2.1

Welcome to the meta-programming world. This world is entirely different than everything else you've seen before.
Let's start at the beginning. To solve that problem you need to think recursively. As every recursion algorithm, you need a recursive relation and a base case (or few of them). Right now you may think: "Ok, so I need to write a template function..."
not exactly. Functions in C++ cannot be partially specialised, but you can create specialised struct/class (look how the assert statement is written).

Do you know how to tackle that problem right now?
