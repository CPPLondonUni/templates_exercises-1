# Ex. 1.1

Writing a template which allows you to compare 2 elements of the same type is simple, 
but when you add one more type to that riddle, so right now 2 elements may have an arbitrary type, 
you also need to specify the return type. Now the problem is a little bit more complicated. 
Of course, you can use some advanced stuff, like for example `std::common_type<T0, T1>::type`,
which returns the common type for given parameters, or just specify return type as another 
template parameter which is inconvenient for a user.
You can also use one of the C++14 features, to solve that problem and make the code more readable. 

Do you know what feature is it?
